Let them Speak is symbolic; it expresses my intention to give voice to millions of murdered Holocaust victims, to the Drowned, as Primo Levi, the Italian writer and Holocaust survivor, named them. In Search of the Drowned is a hybrid publication with various components bringing together survivors’ testimonies, digital history, computer science, philosophy, and personal memory
